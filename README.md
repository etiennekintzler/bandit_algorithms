This goal is to offer some the visual interpretation of bandit algorithms output.

There are currently 2 notebook:

- `linUCB.ipynb`:  LinUCB algorithm (disjoint model case) from [A Contextual-Bandit Approach to Personalized News Article Recommendation (Li et al 2010 )](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.0146)

- `bandit_model_selection.ipynb`: Bandits are used for online model selection. This feature is for now experimental. It relies heavily on the Python online ML library [river](https://github.com/online-ml/river/)
